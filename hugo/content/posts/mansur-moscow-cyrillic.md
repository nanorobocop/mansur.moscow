This site ([mansur.moscow](https://mansur.moscow)) has a mirror - ([мансур.москва](https://мансур.москва)).

It is IDN (International Domain Name) with Cyrillic letters.

Under the hood this cyrillic name translated to ([xn--80axemem.xn--80adxhks](https://xn--80axemem.xn--80adxhks)).

I've registered it in purpose to see how mail routing works with non-latin domain.

While initial testing done several years ago (during working at KL), there's still a plan to maintain this domain just for fun.
