Started diving into circuit design recently, mainly using Arduino.

But noticed that for some functions, it's not even necessary to have microcontroller.
Simple components - like resistors, capacitors and transistors -
can also create dynamic effects.

For example, garland with blinking LEDs can be made using so called
[multivibrator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivibrator) circuit.

After soldering, it could be hanged on a Christmas tree :)

Happy New Year!
