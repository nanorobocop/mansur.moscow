One of the test assignments I've received was about creation a Thumbnail service.

There're few reasons why this assignment is really good. 
First, it is the company's main service.
Second, the actual work is very relevant to job position.

I really enjoyed working on this assignment.

There're few links about it:

* Monitoring: TBD
