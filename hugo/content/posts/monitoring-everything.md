Collecting and analyzing metrics is very important for production services.
And it is also very interesting.
The ability to visualize metrics and do monitoring over time can give lots of understanding about the process.
Will it be system metrics (like Load Average, CPU, memory and disk usage) or health metrics (like heartbeats or child growth speed).
