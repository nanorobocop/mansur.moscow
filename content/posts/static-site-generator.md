This site ([mansur.moscow](https://mansur.moscow)) is a static web site:

* Written in markdown
* Hosted on [Github](https://github.com/nanorobocop)
* Statically generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
* Uses slightly modified [Hestia Pure](https://themes.gohugo.io/hestia-pure/) theme
* Delivered using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com)

Having site built by static site generator have several advantages:

* Easy versioning (everything is in Git)
* Fast generation (22ms for now!)
