Years ago, before computer era, when trying to protect information in secret,
it was necessary to use some physical devices.
Like storing documents behind padlock,
creating tools like [cipher disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher_disk)
to transmit securely,
or even using Enigma machine.

Nowadays, when talking about information security,
we usually think about different algorithms.
Modern cryptography is a lot of math transformed into computer programs.
So everything looks like just a sequence of bits to encrypt, decrypt and authenticate.

Actually, there're still pretty many physical devices,
that are used for information security.
It's easy to mention different kinds of tokens, like RFID, USB (Yubico) or OTP [tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_token).

But recently, there're coming new security devices.
Like [noise generators](https://www.crowdsupply.com/13-37/infinite-noise-trng),
that are using physical world as source of entropy for random number generators.
Or even very low-end thing like [Dicekeys](https://dicekeys.com/).

I found myself it's nice to have such kind of security devices in a physical form.
Not only because it's possible to use them as intended.
But also to show to others and describe security using examples from real world.
