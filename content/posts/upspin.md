Tried a new (for me) file sharing service called Upspin. 
It is created by Go-lang community and has some nice ideas about file sharing.

Some of them are:
* Global namespace of users (linked to email address) and files
* Secure by default

Disadvantages from first sight:
* Small popularity (compared to popular cloud services and self-hosted solutions)
*
